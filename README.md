## What is JUSTUNINS?
JUSTUNINS is a Windows debloat that you can uninstall most of the MS Store programs fastly.
## Cool! How do i get it?
Just go to releases tab, and get the latest. Enjoy!
## Source Code?
You can already look into the ps1 codes, they are %100 readable.
## I dont want to install it though
Just run this command on cmd:

(ADMIN NEEDED AGAIN) 
- powershell iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snixf/JUSTUNINS/main/JUSTUNINS.bat -o JUSTUNINS.bat && JUSTUNINS.bat

## The batch deleted something i didnt want to!
Just check the source code of the batch file, once you find the app, copy what command it type and paste into your cmd but instead of "winget uninstall"
just make it "install".
